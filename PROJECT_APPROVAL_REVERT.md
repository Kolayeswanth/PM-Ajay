# Project Approval - State Filter Removed

## Date: December 3, 2025

### ✅ **REVERT COMPLETE**

The **State Filter** (All States dropdown) has been removed from the **Project Approval** page (`AnnualPlansApproval.jsx`) as requested.

## 🔄 **Current State:**

- **Dropdowns:** Only the **Status Filter** remains (`[ All Proposals ▼ ]`).
