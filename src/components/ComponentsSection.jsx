                            The construction of hostels is one of the means to enable and encourage students belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) to attain quality education. Such hostels are immensely beneficial to the students hailing from rural and remote areas of the country. While the component of construction of hostels for SC girls is in operation from the Third Five Year Plan (1961–66), the same for boys was started with effect from the year 1989–90.
